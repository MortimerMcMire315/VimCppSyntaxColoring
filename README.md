VimCppSyntaxColoring
====================

Adds syntax coloring for classes, functions, and objects. Simply copy the file to ~/.vim/syntax/ and be on your merry way. 
The only hi defs that I added are cCustomFunction and cCustomClass. You can adjust those to your liking in your .vimrc, or 
use the default, which gives them Vim's "Function" highlighting. Enjoy!
