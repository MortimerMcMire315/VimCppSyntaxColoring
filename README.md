VimCppSyntaxColoring
====================

Adds syntax coloring for classes, functions, and objects. Simply copy the file to ~/.vim/syntax/ and be on your merry way. The only hi defs that I added are cCustomFunction and cCustomClass. You can adjust those to your liking in your .vimrc, or use the default, which gives them Vim's "Function" highlighting. Enjoy! Also, this might not work for you if you use some kind of weird-ass naming scheme. Function names have to be made up of letters, numbers, and underscores. If it doesn'twork for you becuase you name your functions with other symbols that I didn't even know were possible to use... you need to use a better naming scheme.
